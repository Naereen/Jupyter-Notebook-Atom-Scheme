# Jupyter-Notebook - Dark Scheme

This is a completely dark theme for the [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.jupyter.org/) interface.

> Note: Source code coloring is based on the Twilight theme for Textmate. Print preview output for notebooks retains a white background with printable foreground colors.

## Installing
To install this theme, copy or symlink this file [`custom.css`](https://github.com/Naereen/Jupyter-Notebook-Atom-Scheme/raw/master/custom.css) into the folder `~/.jupyter/custom/`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.jupyter/custom/
cd ~/.jupyter/custom/
```

If needed, edit it as you wish:

```bash
nano custom.css
```

Then, whenever you run jupyter notebook (for Python or [other languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)) it will use this theme.

You can try [with the test notebook](test/test.ipynb).
