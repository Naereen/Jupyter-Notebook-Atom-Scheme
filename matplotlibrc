### MATPLOTLIBRC FORMAT

# This is a sample matplotlib configuration file - you can find a copy
# of it on your system in
# site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc.  If you edit it
# there, please note that it will be overridden in your next install.
# If you want to keep a permanent local copy that will not be
# over-written, place it in HOME/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc (unix/linux
# like systems) and C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\.matplotlib
# (win32 systems).
#
# This file is best viewed in a editor which supports python mode
# syntax highlighting. Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment
# symbol, are ignored, as are trailing comments.  Other lines must
# have the format
#    key : val # optional comment
#
# Colors: for the color values below, you can either use - a
# matplotlib color string, such as r, k, or b - an rgb tuple, such as
# (1.0, 0.5, 0.0) - a hex string, such as ff00ff or #ff00ff - a scalar
# grayscale intensity such as 0.75 - a legal html color name, eg red,
# blue, darkslategray
